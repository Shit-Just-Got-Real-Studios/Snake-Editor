# Snake-Editor

##Directions for usage:

In order to place the blocks, first we need to view the 3D scene as 2D, so that we can easily place the blocks on the grid. For that, click on "2D" which is shown in the screenshot below, and then Select "Grid" from Hierarchy, and then under "Select Tile", as the name suggests, choose any cube to place and Left-click to place the block, and Right-click to delete the block.
