# Snake-Editor

##Directions for usage:

In order to place the blocks, first we need to view the 3D scene as 2D, so that we can easily place the blocks on the grid.<br/> For that, click on "2D" which is shown in the screenshot below. <br/> Then to place the blocks, Select "Grid" from Hierarchy, and then under "Select Tile" which shows up in the Inspector menu, as shown in the screenshot, as the name suggests, choose any cube to place and Left-click to place the block on the grid, where the mouse is pointing, and Right-click to delete the block, wherever the mouse points.
