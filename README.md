##Directions for usage:

In order to place the blocks, first we need to view the 3D scene as 2D, so that we can easily place the blocks on the grid.<br/> For that, click on <b>"2D"</b> which is shown in the screenshot below. <br/> Then to place the blocks, Select <b>"Grid" from Hierarchy</b>, and then under <b>"Select Tile"</b> which shows up in the Inspector menu, as shown in the screenshot, as the name suggests, choose any cube to place and <b>Left-click</b> to place the block on the grid, where the mouse is pointing, and <b>Right-click</b> to delete the block, wherever the mouse points.

##How to add new blocks to the TileSet?
In case the given sample blocks don't suffice, then to add new blocks to the Tile set, so that they can be used in the game, the procedure goes as follows: <br />
1) As shown in the screenshot below, select <b>"TileSet" prefab from the Project Manager window</b>, and it opens up the prefab's properties on the right. Currently, the size of the TileSet is 4, but if you want to add new blocks/prefabs to the TileSet, then increase the size accordingly, say make the size 5 if you want to add just 1 more block to the set, or 6 if you want to add 2 more. <br/>
2)Then select Element 4, or Element 5, depending on the number of blocks you want to be added, and then select the new block to be added there, and hit "Save" of course. After this, you can use the TileSet normally in the Grid prefab.
